# PseudoHuman

Multiplayer online game where there is a prompt given, and there are multiple answers all generated by ai. However, there is an imposter among the ai who is actually a human, who will also answer the prompts in real time. The person guessing chooses the answer that they think the person made. This repeats with the roles swapped probably around 3 times. Whoever got picked the least loses.

Kind of inspired by the [Human Or Not](https://www.humanornot.ai) game.

The game is live now [hosted here.](https://pseudohuman.vercel.app)

The frontend NextJs project is [hosted on Vercel](https://vercel.com/home) using a [Supabase database](https://supabase.com). Backend websocket server hosted on [Render](https://render.com).

There is a [cron job](https://www.val.town/v/titanplayz/server_thing) enabled, which is a repeated task to send a request to a server. This is to keep the server always active, as usually it sleeps every 15 minutes.

The Large Language Models used in this project are from [Cohere](https://dashboard.cohere.com/) and from [Google's Gemini](https://aistudio.google.com/app).
