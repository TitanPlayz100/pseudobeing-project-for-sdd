# PseudoHuman

Multiplayer online game where there is a prompt given, and there are multiple answers all generated by ai. However, there is an imposter among the people who is actually a human, who will also answer the prompts in real time. The person guessing chooses the answer that they think the person made. This repeats with the roles swapped probably around 3 times. Whoever got picked the least loses.

Kind of inspired by the [Human Or Not](https://www.humanornot.ai) game.
